#Web Design Challenge

Welcome to my Web Design Challenge where I will integrate what I've learned with both HTML and CSS. 
With this challenge, I used a bootstrap/bootswatch theme and integrated it into my html page, to give it a little extra color. 

You will find all of my pages on the main repo, as I did not want to put them in a separate folder at this time, but understand in the future, that it will be necessary. 
I had the code already fixed up when I had learned about putting them in separate folders, and didn't want to risk breaking my code by making adjustments that weren't required via the assignment. 

The hardest part of this challenge was making the containers match and learning the differences between the 12 size options. The drop down option was also tough, even with a provided nav bar code, because I needed to get it to the right side instead of the default left. 

Please take a look and as always, includ details of what I did correctly and what could have been better.
I am open to positive criticism. 

Thank you and have a wonderful day!
